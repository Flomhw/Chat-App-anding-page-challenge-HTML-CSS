# Chat-App-landing-page-challenge-HTML-CSS frontend Mentor
Here is my answer to the Chat App challenge from Frontend mentor. 
Definetely a fun project that helped me review my skills. I'd love feedback on several points though :
1. My media queries feel inconsistant i'd love solutions to improve it.
2. My usage of units might be inconsistent as well on certain elements.
3. I'd love advice on where i could have exploit more features of SASS to code smarter.
